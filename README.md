# Movie Tiers
With Movie Tiers you can rank movies and TV shows into your personally made catagories! With a built-in search engine, 
you can search for a desired Movie/TV Show poster right in the app.
After finding the poster you need, tap on it to save it in your inventory. Inventory posters will be saved even if 
you're offline. Save as much as you need and do the organizing later!
